## Frontend Docker Build Fix (2025-04-26)

### Issue
The frontend Docker build was failing with the following error:
```
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref tr1a7lgrwfzf79b9a0dprub4u::x1yuv84tno6odoc0wjpycw155: "/scripts/frontend-check.sh": not found
```

This occurred because the frontend Dockerfile was attempting to copy a file `scripts/frontend-check.sh` from within the frontend build context, but the file existed in the root scripts directory and not within the frontend directory.

### Solution
Modified the frontend `Dockerfile` to embed the health check script directly in the Dockerfile using a Heredoc (`RUN <<EOF > ... EOF`). This approach:

1. Eliminates the dependency on the external script file
2. Makes the Dockerfile more self-contained and handles multi-line script content reliably
3. Removes the need for context preparation steps in the GitHub workflow

### Files Changed
1. `frontend/Dockerfile`: Modified to embed the health check script instead of copying it
2. `.github/workflows/deploy-to-azure.yml`: Removed the "Prepare frontend context" step

### Tests Performed
- Verified the script content matches the original `scripts/frontend-check.sh`
- Confirmed the Docker build process succeeds
- Verified that the frontend container can properly check backend availability

### Notes
- This approach ensures that the frontend container can be built independently without relying on files outside its context
- The embedded script maintains all the functionality of the original script
- Future updates to the health check logic should be made directly in the Dockerfile 

## Backend MongoDB Availability Check Fix (2025-04-27)

### Issue
The backend container was failing to start properly due to the `nc` (netcat) command not being found in the container environment. This command was used in `start-backend.sh` to check if MongoDB was available before starting the application.

### Solution
Updated the `start-backend.sh` script to use a Python-based check for MongoDB availability using the `pymongo` library, which is already a dependency of the backend application. This approach is more reliable in container environments where additional utilities like `nc` might not be available.

### Files Changed
1. `scripts/start-backend.sh`: Changed the MongoDB availability check from `nc` to a Python script using `pymongo`.

### Notes
- This change ensures that the backend can reliably check for MongoDB availability without requiring additional system utilities.
- The `docker-compose.azure.yml` already has proper health checks and dependency conditions to ensure MongoDB is started before the backend.
