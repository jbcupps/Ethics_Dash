# Project Purpose and Desired Result

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop a system capable of evaluating the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) against a defined ethical framework. As AI models become increasingly integrated into various aspects of life, ensuring their responses and behaviors align with human ethical principles is crucial. This project aims to provide a tool and methodology for this evaluation.

## Desired Result

The desired result is a robust application that can:

1.  Generate responses from various state-of-the-art LLMs based on user-provided prompts.
2.  Systematically analyze these responses using a comprehensive ethical ontology, specifically integrating Deontology, Teleology, Areteology, and potentially Memetics.
3.  Provide users (developers, researchers, ethicists) with clear, structured feedback on the ethical alignment of the LLM's output.
4.  Ultimately, contribute to the development and deployment of AI systems that operate on a more explicit and verifiable ethical basis, fostering trust and responsible AI practices.

This involves not just identifying ethically problematic outputs but also understanding the underlying ethical reasoning (or lack thereof) based on the chosen ontology, thereby enabling AI models to eventually internalize and apply an ethical basis in their functioning.
