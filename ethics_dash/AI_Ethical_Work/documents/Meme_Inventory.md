To construct an upper ontology for your 132 foundational ethical terms, we need a high-level, hierarchical conceptual schema that organizes these terms into abstract categories (classes), their relationships (e.g., subsumption, dependency), and disjoint distinctions.
This ontology is designed to be:
Minimal: no term redundancy or definition overlap.


Modular: allows extension by ethical theory, tradition, or system.


Philosophically coherent: grounded in analytic and classical traditions.


Here is the proposed structure:
